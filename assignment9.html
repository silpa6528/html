<h2><b>COMPUTER</b></h2>
<a href="#top">Go to top</a><br>
<font size="5">A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs.</font><br>

<a id="CPU"></a>
<h3>CPU</h3>
<font size="5">A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor or main processor, is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions.
</font><br>

<a id="ALU"></a>
<h3>ALU</h3>
<font size="5">An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a combinational digital electronic circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers. This is in contrast to a floating-point unit (FPU), which operates on floating point numbers. An ALU is a fundamental building block of many types of computing circuits, including the central processing unit (CPU) of computers, FPUs, and graphics processing units (GPUs). A single CPU, FPU or GPU may contain multiple ALUs</font><br>

	<h2>PROGRAMING LANGUAGE</h2><br>
	<font size="5">A programming language is a formal language, which comprises a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms</font><br>

    <a id="c"></a>
	<h3><b>c</b></h3><br>
	<font size="5">C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, while a static type system prevents unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly languag</font><br>

   <a id="c++"></a>
	<h3>c++</h3><br>
	<font size="5"p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ has object-oriented, generic</font><br>

<a id="DBMS"></a>
<h2><b>DBMS</b></h2>
<br>	
<font size="5">A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. Where databases are more complex they are often developed using formal design and modeling techniques</font>
<br>

<a id="RDBMS"></a>
<h3><b>RDBMS</b></h3><br>
<font size="5">
	A relational database management system is a database management system that is based on the relational model as invented by E. F. Codd, of IBM's San Jose Research Laboratory. Many popular databases currently in use are based on the relational database model. RDBMSs have become a predominant choice for the storage of information in new databases used for financial records, manufacturing and logistical information, personnel data, and much more since the 1980s.
</font><br>

<a id="OODBMS"></a>
<h3><b>OODBMS</b></h3><br>
<font size="5">An object database is a database management system in which information is represented in the form of objects as used in object-oriented programming. Object databases are different from relational databases which are table-oriented. Object-relational databases are a hybrid of both approaches.</font><br>

<a id="HDBMS"></a>
<h3><b>HDBMS</b></h3><br>
<font size="5">A hierarchical database model is a data model in which the data is organized into a tree-like structure. The data is stored as records which are connected to one another through links. A record is a collection of fields, with each field containing only one value. The entity type of a record defines which fields the record contains.</font><br>

<a id="NWDBMS"></a>
<h3><b>NWDBMS</b></h3><br>
<font size="5">Database Management System or DBMS in short refers to the technology of storing and retrieving usersâ€™ data with utmost efficiency along with appropriate security measures. This tutorial explains the basics of DBMS such as its architecture, data models, data schemas, data independence, E-R mode</font>
